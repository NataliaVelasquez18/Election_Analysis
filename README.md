# Overview of election audit:

The analysis consists in reporting the total number of votes cast, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote.

There are several voting methods taken into account: Mail-in Ballot, punch cards, and direct recording electronic.  These three methods will determine the final election results. After the votes are counted, this audit generates a vote count report to certify this US congressional race.
